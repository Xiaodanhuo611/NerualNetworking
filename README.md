# change the encoding_dim through various values (range(2,18,2) and store or keep track of the best loss you can get. Plot the 8 pairs of dimensions vs loss on a scatter plot
# After training an autoencoder with encoding_dim=8, apply noise (like the previous assignment) to only the input of the trained autoencoder (not the output). 
# The output images should be without noise.
# Print a few noisy images along with the output images to show they don't have noise.
